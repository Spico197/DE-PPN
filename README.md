<h2 id="overview">🧱 Overview</h2>

Code for the paper ["Document-level Event Extraction via Parallel Prediction Networks"](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.492/).

This repo is built on the [official codes](https://github.com/HangYang-NLP/DE-PPN).
The official codes are not available to run due to some missing codes, and I can't wait to have a try, so I complete the missing part and create this repo.

This repo is still under construction, and the program is still running to reproduce the final results.
Due to the time limit, codes are not totally refactored to be more elegant, but I will work on it.

Please be aware that this is not a totally officially implementated version.
If you find any problems, do not hesitate to drop me an issue, or reach me by email.
